## How routing works

When we create a new project with `elm-land init`, a homepage is automatically created for us. A homepage is a great start, but most web applications have multiple pages!

For example, we might want these four pages in our app:

- __Homepage__ - shows a feed of the latest posts
- __Sign in__ - allow users to sign in with email/password
- __Settings__ - allows a user to change their account settings
- __Profile__ - View the profile of a specific user



Page | URLs | Elm file
:-- | :-- | :--
Homepage | `/` | `src/Pages/Home_.elm`
Sign in | `/sign-in` | `src/Pages/SignIn.elm`
Settings | `/settings/account` | `src/Pages/Settings/Account.elm`
Profile | `/profile/ryan`<br/>`/profile/duncan`<br/>`/profile/alexa` | `src/Pages/Profile/Username_.elm`

In _Elm Land_, the names of files in our `src/Pages` automatically connect a URL to a specific page. For example, if we navigated to `/messages` in a web browser, _Elm Land_ would look for a file at `src/Pages/Messages.elm`

In this guide, we'll learn how to use the Elm Land CLI to add new pages by specifying the URL we want to visit in the browser.

### Creating a fresh project

Let's create a new project with the CLI, then run a local development server:

```sh
elm-land init pages-and-layouts
```
```sh
cd pages-and-layouts
```
```sh
elm-land server
```

Now that we have a new Elm Land project, and a server running at `http://localhost:1234` we can use the CLI to add a new page.

## Static routes

To get started, let's start with a page that is displayed when a user visits the URL `/sign-in`. 

We can create our sign-in page using the `elm-land add page` command shown below:

```sh
elm-land add page:static /sign-in
```

```txt
ðŸŒˆ  Elm Land added a new page at /sign-in
    âŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽº
    You can edit your new page here:
    ./src/Pages/SignIn.elm
```

The `elm-land add page:static` command created a view-only page that allows us to customize two things:
- `title` - the text shown in the browser tab
- `body` - the HTML we want to render on the screen

Here's what that code looks like for our `/sign-in` page

```elm
module Pages.SignIn exposing (page)

import Html
import View exposing (View)


page : View msg
page =
    { title = "Pages.SignIn"
    , body = [ Html.text "/sign-in" ]
    }
```

Anytime you run the `elm-land add page` command, a new file will be created in the `src/Pages` folder.

If we visit `http://localhost:1234/sign-in` in the browser, we will see this new page:

![Browser window showing the sign in page](./pages/sign-in.png)

## Nested routes

Some pages in our app need a URL like `/settings/account` or `/settings/notifications`. In _Elm Land_, we refer to these as "nested routes". 

A __nested route__ is what we call a route with more than one slash in the URL. Let's add a nested route for account settings:

```sh
elm-land add page:static /settings/account
```

```txt
ðŸŒˆ  Elm Land added a new page at /settings/account
    âŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽº
    You can edit your new page here:
    ./src/Pages/Settings/Account.elm
```

Here is the code generated at `./src/Pages/Settings/Account.elm`:

```elm
module Pages.Settings.Account exposing (page)

import Html
import View exposing (View)


page : View msg
page =
    { title = "Pages.Settings.Account"
    , body = [ Html.text "/settings/account" ]
    }
```



This is what we see when we visit `http://localhost:1234/settings/account`

![Browser window showing the settings page](./pages/settings.png)

::: tip "How deep can I nest routes?"

You can nest routes as much as you like, it doesn't have to be only two-levels deep:

```sh
elm-land add page:static /something/really/nested/like/super/nested
```

That command will create a file in a __bunch__ of nested folders inside your `src/Pages` directory, and be available when visiting the provided URL.

:::

## Dynamic routes

For things like our "Profile" page, we won't know all the usernames up-front. It's common to define a single detail page that will work for _any_ username provided in the URL.

When we need a page to handle URLs like `/profile/ryan`, `/profile/duncan`, or `/profile/alexa`, we can make a "dynamic route". 

A __dynamic route__ passes in URL parameters (like `username`) to your page as an input, so it can handle the dynamic values.

```sh
elm-land add page:dynamic /profile/:username
```

![Browser window showing the profile page](./pages/profile-ryan.png)


Unlike our static `/sign-in` and `/settings/account` pages, the dynamic profile page has access to a URL parameter input. Let's take a look at the new file together:

```elm
module Pages.Profile.Username_ exposing (page)

import Html
import View exposing (View)


page : { username : String } ->  View msg
page params =
    { title = "Pages.Profile.Username_"
    , body = [ Html.text ("/profile/" ++ params.username) ]
    }
```

Here, the value of `params.username` depends on the URL in the browser. For example, when a user navigates to `/profile/ryan`, the value of `params.username` will be `"ryan"`.

This will be helpful later, when we learn how to work with APIs to fetch different content based on URL parameters.

### Names for dynamic parameters

We learned that names of page files affect which URL renders our page, but they also can affect the names of our URL parameters.

Because our profile page was at `Profile/Username_.elm`, the value for our URL parameter is `params.username`. 

If we renamed this file to `Profile/Id_.elm`, it would automatically update the parameter name to `params.id`. The Elm compiler will let us know if any of our code needs to change, so this isn't a scary thing!

This allows us the flexibility to choose the name that makes sense in each specific scenario.

::: tip "What about numeric IDs?"

Many apps have URLs like `/posts/123`, which use `Int` IDs to work with backend APIs. _Elm Land_ supports these URLs too!

If we made a page at `src/Pages/Posts/Id_.elm`, and visited `/posts/123`, this would be the value of our URL parameters:

```elm
params.id == "123"
```

Notice how `"123"` is a `String`, not an `Int`?

_Elm Land_ treats all URL parameters as `String` values. In practice, whether we get a URL like `/posts/99999` or `/posts/banana`, we'll still show the same "post not found" view in our app. 

Having the "type safety" of `Int` doesn't buy us much in this scenario. This design choice is also consistent with other popular JS frameworks like [Vue's Nuxt.js](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/pages#dynamic-routes) and [React's Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).

:::

::: tip "What's up with the trailing underscores?"
You may have noticed there is a __trailing underscore__ in some of our filenames. What's up with that? 

Here are some reasons you will see an underscore in page filenames:
1. To distinguish `/` (`Home_.elm`) from `/home` (`Home.elm`)
2. To distinguish a __static__ page from a __dynamic__ one:
     - `Profile/Username.elm` only handles `/profile/username`
     - `Profile/Username_.elm` handles `/profile/ryan`, `profile/duncan`, and more!

### Our project so far

After adding in all these pages, our project should look something like this:

```txt
elm.json
elm-land.json
src/
|- Pages/
    |- Home_.elm
    |- SignIn.elm
    |- Settings/
        |- Account.elm
    |- Profile/
        |- Username_.elm
```

## Layouts

So far, to navigate from one page to another, we've been manually changing the URL in the browser. In a real app, our users need a way to navigate the app within the UI. 

For that reason, let's make a sidebar layout with convenient links to the "Homepage", "Account Settings", and "Profile" pages.

We can start by using the `elm-land add` command again, but this time to create a new __layout__:

```sh
elm-land add layout:static Sidebar
```

```txt
ðŸŒˆ  Elm Land added a new layout!
    âŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽºâŽº
    You can edit your layout here:
    ./src/Layouts/Sidebar.elm
```

The `elm-land add layout` command creates a simple layout that we will be able to reuse across multiple pages. Here's the new file that was created in our `src/Layouts` folder:

```elm
module Layouts.Sidebar exposing (layout)

import Html exposing (Html)
import Html.Attributes as Attr
import View exposing (View)


layout : { page : View msg } -> View msg
layout { page } =
    { title = page.title
    , body = 
        [ Html.div [ Attr.class "page" ] page.body
        ]
    }
```

Our new layout file allows us to embed a `page` anywhere we'd like. If you're familiar with Vue.js, this is similar to the idea of "slots"â€“ which allow you to embed one component inside another.

In the default example, we are wrapping the page's content in a `div` with the class `"page"`

### Adding a sidebar

The default layout doesn't have a sidebar, but we can make one with some HTML. Add the highlighted lines below to your new `src/Layouts/Sidebar.elm` file

```elm {12-16,20-26}
module Layouts.Sidebar exposing (layout)

import Html exposing (Html)
import Html.Attributes as Attr
import View exposing (View)


layout : { page : View msg } -> View msg
layout { page } =
    { title = page.title
    , body =
        [ Html.div [ Attr.class "layout" ]
            [ viewSidebar
            , Html.div [ Attr.class "page" ] page.body
            ]
        ]
    }


viewSidebar : Html msg
viewSidebar =
    Html.aside [ Attr.class "sidebar" ]
        [ Html.a [ Attr.href "/" ] [ Html.text "Home" ]
        , Html.a [ Attr.href "/profile/me" ] [ Html.text "Profile" ]
        , Html.a [ Attr.href "/settings/account" ] [ Html.text "Settings" ]
        ]
```


## Using a layout on a page

This new layout file isn't automatically wired up to all our pages. In _Elm Land_, you can easily opt-in to which pages should use which layout by using the generated `Layout` module.

In this example, we don't want a sidebar on the "Sign in" page. 

For that reason, we will only connect it to our "Homepage", "Account Settings", and "Profile" page by adding these lines of code:

```elm {4,8-10}
module Pages.Home_ exposing (page)

import Html
import Layout exposing (Layout)
import View exposing (View)


layout : Layout
layout =
    Layout.Sidebar


page : View msg
page =
    { title = "Homepage"
    , body = [ Html.text "Hello, world!" ]
    }
```

When a page defines a `layout` function, Elm Land will automatically wire it up to the matching layout from the `src/Layouts` folder.

Here are code snippets for how we updated the other two pages (provided for reference):

::: details `src/Pages/Settings/Account.elm`

```elm {4,8-10}
module Pages.Settings.Account exposing (page)

import Html exposing (Html)
import Layout exposing (Layout)
import View exposing (View)


layout : Layout
layout =
    Layout.Sidebar


page : View msg
page =
    { title = "Pages.Settings.Account"
    , body = [ Html.text "/settings/account" ]
    }
```

:::

::: details `src/Pages/Profile/Username_.elm`

```elm {4,8-10}
module Pages.Profile.Username_ exposing (page)

import Html exposing (Html)
import Layout exposing (Layout)
import View exposing (View)


layout : Layout
layout =
    Layout.Sidebar


page : { username : String } -> View msg
page params =
    { title = "Pages.Profile.Username_"
    , body = [ Html.text ("/profile/" ++ params.username) ]
    }
```

:::

## Styling with CSS

All of our pages and layouts are ready, but there's still one missing piece: the page doesn't look pretty.

We can add CSS to our Elm Land projects by modifying the `elm-land.json` file at the root of our project.

We can add `<link>` tags to our HTML by updating the `app.html.link` property like this:

```json {16-18}
{
  "app": {
    "env": [],
    "html": {
      "attributes": {
        "html": { "lang": "en" },
        "head": {},
        "body": {}
      },
      "title": "My Elm Land App",
      "meta": [
        { "charset": "UTF-8" },
        { "http-equiv": "X-UA-Compatible", "content": "IE=edge" },
        { "name": "viewport", "content": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" }
      ],
      "link": [
        { "rel": "stylesheet", "href": "/styles.css" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can serve static files like images or CSS by adding them in a `static` folder at the project root, alongside the `src` folder and `elm-land.json` file.

For this example, let's create a new CSS file at `./static/styles.css`, with the following CSS:

```css
body {
  padding: 32px;
}

.layout {
  display: flex;
  gap: 16px;
}

.sidebar {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 8px;
}
```

Now that we've added in some CSS, we should see our full example working. We can use our sidebar to navigate from one page to another.
