## The source code

If you would like to see how it works, all the code is available and [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/elm-land/elm-land). 

The CLI, docs website, and other related Elm Land projects can all be found in that single repo.

### Running the test suite

The tests in this project are designed to verify that the [official guide](https://elm.land/guide) and [all of the examples](https://github.com/elm-land/elm-land/tree/main/examples) are accurate for users.

For that reason, we are using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to make sure our CLI behaves as expected!

```bash
# Make sure you are in the `./cli` folder!
npm install
npm link
npm run setup
npm run test
```
